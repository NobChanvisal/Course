	Jane: 92
	Mike: 78
	Cristain: 95
	Average grade: 87.5
	Top student: Sarah with 95

5. Update code on exercise 2 create an associative array to store for 4 student and 4 subject 
(e.g. john => [html => 100, css => 100, php => 75], jane => [html => 80, css => 100, php =>100], etc.). write a code to 
- Display each student’s name and grade.
- Calculate and display the average grade.
- Find and display the student with the highest grade.

6. Create a numeric array of 10 random numbers between 1 and 100. Write a script to:
- Display the original array.
- Sort the array in ascending order and display it.
- Sort the array in descending order and display it.
Sample Output:
	Original array: 45, 12, 89, 34, 67, 23, 91, 56, 78, 19
	Ascending order: 12, 19, 23, 34, 45, 56, 67, 78, 89, 91
	Descending order: 91, 89, 78, 67, 56, 45, 34, 23, 19, 12

7. Create a multidimensional array to represent a store’s inventory (at least 3 items with name, price, and quantity)
(e.g.["name" => "Laptop", "price" => 1000, "quantity" => 5], etc.) Write a code to:
- Display the inventory in a formatted table-like output.
- Calculate the total value of the inventory (price * quantity for each item).
- Find the item with the lowest quantity.
Sample output :
	Item: Laptop, Price: $1000, Quantity: 5
	Item: Phone, Price: $600, Quantity: 10
	Item: Tablet, Price: $300, Quantity: 3
	Total inventory value: $11900
	

8. Create an array of 8 numbers. Write a code to:
- Filter out all numbers less than 50 and display the result.
- Double each number in the original array and display the result.
- Use array_filter() and array_map() for these operations.
Sample output
	Original array : 45, 60, 23, 80, 15, 90, 30, 55
	Numbers >= 50 : 60, 80, 90, 55
	Doubled numbers : 90, 120, 46, 160, 30, 180, 60, 110
