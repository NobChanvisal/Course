      <h1>Stripes in Css</h1>
      <p>
        Stripes in CSS are primarily created using the
        <span>repeating-linear-gradient()</span> function on the background-image property.
        This method is lightweight, scalable, and does not require image files,
        making it ideal for responsive designs.
