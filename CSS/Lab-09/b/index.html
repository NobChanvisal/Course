            Angkor Wat is a Theravada Buddhist temple complex and the largest
            religious complex in the world. It was commissioned by the Khmer
            king Suryavarman II (ruled 1113–c. 1150) in the early 12th century
            in Yaśodharapura (present-day Angkor), the capital of the Khmer
            Empire.

          <p class="des">
            Preah Vihear is an ancient edifice built by the Khmer Empire as a
            Hindu temple on top of a 525-metre (1,722 ft) cliff in the Dângrêk
            Mountains, in Cambodia. Over time, it became a Buddhist temple. On
            15 June 1962, the ICJ ruled 9 to 3 that the temple belonged to
            Cambodia, that Thailand was obliged to withdraw all troops stationed
            there and, by a vote of 7 to 5, that Thailand must return any
            antiquities such as sculptures that it had removed from the temple.
